# Sonnet-generation Using AI
The model has been trained using LSTM with a dataset of a collection of sonnets. The model is trained to generate character level sonnets. A user interface is provided using Flask inorder to integrate the trained model with the user in an interactive way.

## Environment Setup
The following installations should be done during environment setup int the terminal.
* Python (3.x)
`pip install python3`
* Numpy 
`pip install numpy`
* Matplotlib
`pip install matplotlib`
* Scipy
`pip install scipy`
* scikit-learn
`pip install -U scikit-learn`
* Seaborn
`pip install seaborn`
* Tensorflow 
`pip install tensorflow`
* Keras 
`pip install keras`

## Generating Sonnets
Follow the below steps to view the sonnet generation in your browser:
* Clone the repository into the folder where the environment has been setup.
* Navigate to the directory named 'Sonnet-generation' from the terminal.
* Run the following command:
`python3 app.py`
* Follow the http link that is displayed on the terminal and open that page on your browser
